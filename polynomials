## some tricks in polynomial's multiplication

~~ Suppose we want to multiply polynomial in the following form:
(1+x)*(1+x^2)
Well, we can do it by distrubutive property:
We'll get : x^3+x^2+x+1
But we can invent some kind of formula to multiply polynomial in form like this one:
(1+x^2^0)*(1+x^2^1)*(1+x^2^2)*...*(1+x^2^n)
After a few experiments, it turned out to this pattern:
(1+x^2^0)*(1+x^2^1)*(1+x^2^2)*...*(1+x^2^n) = 1+x+x^2+...+x^(2^n+2^(n-1)+...+2^1+2^0)
We can check this out by the following example:
(1+x)*(1+x^2)*(1+x^4)*(1+x^8) = (1+x^(2^0))*(1+x^(2^1))*(1+x^(2^2))*(1+x^(2^3)) = 1+x+x^2+..+x^14+x^15
And this example proves our guess.

~~ It take me some time to came up with this trick :
Suppose we want to take square of the polynomial like this one (1+x+x^2+...+x^n)^2
Well, computing only powers of x's without coefficients is easy-enough and looks like multiplying in interval arithmetic
We simply take the lowest term (in our case its 1) and the bigger term (in our case its x^n) and we should write down
a sequence with all power of x's between 1 and x^2n (2n due to squaring) (and again, without coefficients at this point) :
(1+x+x^2+...+x^n)^2 = 1+x+x^2+...+x^(2n-1)+x^2n
And now the most hard part : we should somehow compute the coefficients:
I came to the point where I have no idea that the fuck I am doing/writing:
  coefficents follow the same pattern as power's of x's except that they'll start to reduce after reaching "middle point"
  Wtf is middle point? well,its the upper term in out original equation, or x^n:
  so after reaching this point, they would start to reducing by 1 (I have an abstract theory about that, but I'll simply 
  would not be able to write this down, thought. 
  1+2x+3x^2+...n+1*x^n (middle point)+n*x^(n+1)+..+2*x^(2n-1)+x^2n
  As you can see, every coeffiecient on first part of the sequence is equal to (power of related x) + 1
